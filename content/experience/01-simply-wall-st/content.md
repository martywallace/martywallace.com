My original responsibilities at Simply Wall St were within the growth team, where I was able to help design and then take on the development work of software that drove the lion's share of our user acquisition over multiple years.

I have since transitioned onto the platform team, where I look after much of the foundational architecture that the business runs on, such as GraphQL. I am responsible for developer experience across engineering teams and driving discussions and decision making for new and improved ways to deliver technical work that help the team and our customers alike.

My long tenure combined with my involvement and exposure to most of the systems that Simply Wall St runs on puts me in a unique position of being a go-to resource for newer and longer serving staff alike, which allows me to act as a strong force multiplier.

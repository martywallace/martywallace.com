Worked within a small development team of less than 5 people that sat within the broader Ensemble business, enriching their marketing projects with digital elements including bespoke self-service software for Nestl√© pop-up stores. As the sole developer with backend and infrastructure experience on the team, I was responsible for the overall technical execution of these projects, which included setting up and managing the on-site hardware and cloud infrastructure, bug fixes and improvements often during business hours, and ensuring a smooth experience for the client, their customers and their staff.

I was also responsible for more typical web-based projects such as small business websites built on WordPress or Craft CMS and tooling for both internal use and for our clients to improve business operations and streamline clunky processes.
